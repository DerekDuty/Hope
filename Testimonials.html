	 			<p class="story"> Everywhere you go houses are destroyed, restaurants are destroyed, businesses are destroyed. Here we are almost a month later and our town is still destroyed. This isn’t something that can be fixed overnight. This will take years to ever look just semi normal again. Nothing will ever look the way it did before this storm. Everywhere you go there are blue tarps on houses, there are no standing trees. Every street is lined with piles of debris from trees, trash, people’s belongings that used to be in their homes...piles and piles of trash line our streets. People that once had homes are now living in tents on the sides of roads and parking lots. I’ve seen pregnant women living in tents...families with kids. It’s rained several times and they have no where to go but their little tents exposed to everything around them. Some people still are wearing the same clothes they were almost a month ago. Some have no food. No water. No money. No car. Nothing.<br />

			<div class="text-overflow2">
	 			<p class="story"> On day eleven, I found sleep without medication. I rolled over, looking at my phone to scroll Social Media and saw that The Old Sentry was still standing. It’s this tree that stands in the middle of a park called “Oaks by the Bay.” It’s the most gorgeous oak I’ve ever seen, the kind of tree that makes you think of fairies and realms of another time, a landmark of ages past. I sat back and imagined this tree speaking to each visitor that came to check on its wellbeing. "I have seen wars and rumors of wars. I have survived hurricanes and floods and lightening and thunder. I am old and I am tired, but I have survived because my roots go deep." I felt myself sinking into the bed.</p>

			<div class="text-overflow3">
	 			<p class="story"> Choosing to stay in Panama City means your new alarm clock is the sound of chainsaws reving up as soon as day breaks. Going from your house to car may mean stepping over knocked down trees and dodging bumblebees. There's people waving from the tops of roofs as at this point every roof and building side has been tarped. Volunteers and workers are vigorously working on school campuses so that we can give our children back some form of normalcy. Schools schedules have been changed to split times. Staying means seeing people in tents in front of their destroyed houses. Long lines in a grocery store because there's maybe 3 open now. But still being thankful for the hot meals handed out by red cross. So please stop asking us to stop talking about something we're still living everyday.</p>

  	<h2 class="storytitle">I can't feel it</h2>
		<div class="text-overflow4">
	 		<p class="story"> Today I stood over the washing machine and peered in trying to remember if I'd added soap already. There were no signs. No clean scent, no suds. Already half full of water, I'd loaded the washer with half-damp half-crusty stinky rags. I can't smell the clean scent of soap. There's a scent in the washer but I can't smell it. There's a splinter in my finger but I can't feel it. There's death and destruction beyond my street but I can't see it.<br />Is this tragedy? Is this catastrophe? I guess there's no clean scent in catastrophe. Are we 'survivors'? Will the reward for getting a new roof months before the storm be as strong as the punishment for not boarding up? If the windows hadn't blown, would the whole house have gone? Board up before or board up after.Did I add the soap? Why can't I tell?</p>

   	<h2 class="storytitle">The Pew</h2>
		<div class="text-overflow5">
	 	<p class="story"> This pew sat in our lobby until hurricane Michael soaked it. Today we had it carried to the corner of our busy intersection. It was not there for 30 minutes before the first two people found rest in that pew. Melissa and her daughter Jasmine walked from Callaway on their way to Bay Medical Center and it was one of the few places they found where they could sit and rest. We ministered to them with cold drinks and fresh fruit and provisions to take home and provided them a ride to Bay medical. Who said the pew needed to be in the church? It went to where the people are… Just like Jesus.</p>

   <h2 class="storytitle">I could feel the walls breathe</h2>
		<div class="text-overflow6">
	 		<p class="story"> I could hear large objects hitting the house and heard the trees falling on our neighbors’ homes. In fact, I heard when our backyard neighbor’s large sycamore tree hit their house. I used to love listening to the breeze rustling the leaves on that tree. It’s been around for decades and now it’s gone. As I lay in bed, I would press my hands against the walls and I swear to you, I could feel them “breathe.” It was the most terrified I have ever been, and I thank God that I survived. I knew we had to go through hours more of the same thing. There was nothing to do but wait, pray, and hope. After the storm was over, we went outside. The entire backyard was gone, the roof was severely damaged, we had water leaking into the ceiling. The porch posts blew away, the satellite dish tore off part of the roof, and trees we’d have for years are twisted – that is, the ones that remain. All of the storage sheds were gone, with years of memories strewn throughout the yard along with tools.</p>
