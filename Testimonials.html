			<div class="text-overflow1">
	 			<p class="story"> Everywhere you go houses are destroyed, restaurants are destroyed, businesses are destroyed. Here we are almost a month later and our town is still destroyed. This isn’t something that can be fixed overnight. This will take years to ever look just semi normal again. Nothing will ever look the way it did before this storm. Everywhere you go there are blue tarps on houses, there are no standing fences, no standing trees. You miss your turn on streets you drive everyday because they are still unrecognizable. Kids have just now started to go back to school. People are still out of jobs. Every street is lined with piles of debris from trees, trash, people’s belongings that used to be in their homes...piles and piles of trash line our streets. Businesses are going to have to shut down if they can’t find employees to work. Several people have left and are never coming back. People with their own businesses lost both that and their homes and now have nothing. People that once had homes are now living in tents on the sides of roads and parking lots. I’ve seen pregnant women living in tents...families with kids. It’s rained several times and they have no where to go but their little tents exposed to everything around them. Some people still are wearing the same clothes they were almost a month ago. Some have no food. No water. No money. No car. Nothing.<br />People are now forgetting about us. We are not getting the coverage we deserve. People that have not gone through this, have no idea. You truly do not have any idea what this is like unless you have gone through it. Whether you were here during the storm and rode it out in fear in your home or you can back to town to a destroyed home. People keep telling us that it takes time, everything will be okay, we will rebuild, etc. Yes, we know that. We are living this nightmare, of course we know that. We also know that it is going to take years for that to happen. We will not re build over night, even though we wish we could. People are going to be struggling for a long time. No one will have as much income as they did before. It could be up to a year before people’s homes are even finished being built, which is how it’s looking for my family. Meanwhile you have to worry about where you are going to keep staying until then and how you are going to pay for it

   		<h2 class="storytitle">Sleep</h2>
			<div class="text-overflow2">
	 			<p class="story"> On day eleven, I found sleep without medication. Only 4 hours, but still it was sleep. I rolled over, looking at my phone to scroll Social Media and saw that The Old Sentry was still standing. It’s this tree that stands in the middle of a park called “Oaks by the Bay.” It’s the most gorgeous oak I’ve ever seen, the kind of tree that makes you think of fairies and realms of another time, a landmark of ages past.<br />The sign marking its place reads, "This Heritage Oak Tree is estimated to be over 250 years old. It was standing during the war between the states as if a sentry standing guard over St. Andrews Bay." The over 250 year Old Sentry defied Michael. It stood up to the storm of storms and laughed, “You’ll have to do better than that to take me down.”<br />So I laughed with it. I laughed and laughed and laughed until my kids ran in asking what was so funny. “This tree,” I said through tears. “This tree was absolutely unbothered by bully Michael. Look at it, it hardly lost a twig. I bet you it didn’t lose a wink of sleep over this storm, before or after."<br />I sat back and imagined this tree speaking to each visitor that came to check on its wellbeing. "I have seen wars and rumors of wars. I have survived hurricanes and floods and lightening and thunder. I am old and I am tired, but I have survived because my roots go deep." I felt myself sinking into the bed, a great wave of peace washing over me.</p>

   		<h2 class="storytitle">Normalcy</h2>
			<div class="text-overflow3">
	 			<p class="story"> Choosing to stay in Panama City means your new alarm clock is the sound of chainsaws reving up as soon as day breaks. Going from your house to car may mean stepping over knocked down trees and dodging bumblebees. I've been stung! Your neighbors knock to return items of yours that have blown into their yards. There's people waving from the tops of roofs as at this point every roof and building side has been tarped. Volunteers and workers are vigorously working on school campuses so that we can give our children back some form of normalcy. Schools schedules have been changed to split times. Half the day for older students half the day for middle schools. Shared campuses for some elementary. Staying means seeing people in tents in front of their destroyed houses with signs up that says "You loot we shoot". So much law enforcement from Miami dade, Sumpter county, Pensacola and Tampa police. Getting excited for a simple light to turn on and thanking Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and our very own Gulf Power. Shares of posts of where to find food, water, diapers, and other basic needs. Long lines in a grocery store because there's maybe 3 open now. Getting excited to see one of your favorite restaurants reopen back up. But still being thankful for the millions of hot meals handed out by red cross. Staying means looking at completely destroyed buildings you've seen everyday. Getting confused about where you are because trees really do make a difference and now there are none. Staring at a demolished building and trying to remember what that place was. Have you ever watched someone pull up to their house and just get out and start crying because there's nothing left? I have. Staying means saying goodbye to people you've known for years because they've been forced to move. So please stop asking us to stop talking about something we're still living everyday.</p>

  	<h2 class="storytitle">I can't feel it</h2>
		<div class="text-overflow4">
	 		<p class="story"> Today I stood over the washing machine and peered in trying to remember if I'd added soap already. There were no signs. No clean scent, no suds. I'm sure I already added the soap?<br />Already half full of water, I'd loaded the washer with half-damp half-crusty stinky rags. Hurricane rags. We used them to sop up rain water that blew into the house and puddled in our dishes and in the corners, creeped behind cabinets and in computers.<br />I can't smell the clean scent of soap; nor the stink of hurricane rags. There's nothing. No thing. No sign.<br />There's a scent in the washer but I can't smell it. There's a splinter in my finger but I can't feel it. There's death and destruction beyond my street but I can't see it. There's sadness in these Hurricane rags, but I can't feel it.<br />Is this tragedy? Is this catastrophe? I guess there's no clean scent in catastrophe. A privilege, doing laundry. In a house with power and water and sewer. Are we 'survivors'? Will the reward for getting a new roof months before the storm be as strong as the punishment for not boarding up? If the windows hadn't blown, would the whole house have gone? Board up before or board up after.<br />It's dark in the house with less windows. Extra roof panels hastily screwed up to cover the gaping rectangular holes.<br />This is grief, isn't it? It snuggled itself in all cozy like. I did so good this last 16 days. Doing the things. Fix the problems. Close the breech. Get the water. Dump the ice. Make it safe. Get the wet out. Save the treasures. Do the things. Toss the ruins. Remember all the things. Sleep with your car keys. Charge the phone. It works for 911. Feed the dog. Eat the food. Brush your teeth. Rest. Do the work. Don't get sad. Clean up the glass. All the glass. Don't get cut. Be careful. Watch for nails. Tetanus shots are free. Stand in line. Have cash. Check on the neighbors. Walk. Look. See. Charge the battery. Secure the house. Listen. Smell. Lock up your money. Don't get too hot. Do the things.<br />Did I add the soap? Why can't I tell?<br />This is grief, isn't it? It's snuggled itself into all my being, taken hold in every crevice, breeding like mold.</p>

   	<h2 class="storytitle">The Pew</h2>
		<div class="text-overflow5">
	 	<p class="story"> This pew sat in our lobby until hurricane Michael soaked it. Today we had it carried to the corner of our busy intersection. It was not there for 30 minutes before the first two people found rest in that pew. Melissa and her daughter Jasmine walked from Callaway on their way to Bay Medical Center and it was one of the few places they found where they could sit and rest. We ministered to them with cold drinks and fresh fruit and provisions to take home and provided them a ride to Bay medical. Who said the pew needed to be in the church? It went to where the people are… Just like Jesus.</p>

   <h2 class="storytitle">I could feel the walls breathe</h2>
		<div class="text-overflow6">
	 		<p class="story"> I could hear large objects hitting the house and heard the trees falling on our neighbors’ homes. In fact, I heard when our backyard neighbor’s large sycamore tree hit their house. Fortunately, they yelled out a few curse words, not cries for help so we knew they were okay. Not as if we could have ventured out to help them anyway. I used to love listening to the breeze rustling the leaves on that tree. It’s been around for decades and now it’s gone.<br />As I lay in bed, I would press my hands against the walls and I swear to you, I could feel them “breathe.” It was the most terrified I have ever been, and I thank God that I survived.<br />When the eye crossed over, I knew we had to go through hours more of the same thing. We’d lost power, we’d lost phone service. There was nothing to do but wait, pray, and hope.<br />After the storm was over, we went outside and it was wonderful to see our neighbors out, some we had never even met, checking to see if anyone needed help.<br />Our close neighbors had a tree on their roof, along with their carport upside down on that same roof. And the church that has been in our neighborhood for decades, was decimated. That is just some of the immediate damage we saw and then I saw my own house.<br />The entire backyard was gone, the roof was severely damaged, we had water leaking into the ceiling, the entire privacy fence is damaged or in some cases, missing entirely. The porch posts blew away, the satellite dish tore off part of the roof, and trees we’d have for years are twisted – that is, the ones that remain. All of the storage sheds were gone, with years of memories strewn throughout the yard along with tools, the Christmas tree and decorations, and ironically, a brand new generator.<br />After the storm, we sat all night listening to the radio about the devastation and hearing some of the stories from people who could call in, or the DJs who had weathered it out at the station. It was hot, it was dark, and it was scary, but just hearing a friendly voice made us feel that we weren’t alone in the world.</p>
