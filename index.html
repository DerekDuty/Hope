	 <h1>Biography</h1>
	 <p>Ever since I was young I liked creating and designing things from my imagination. Anything I had interest in I wanted to design something for. From album covers of imaginary bands to professional skateboards to the layout and designs of sponsors on racecars. Anything that had the importance of grabbing someoneâ€™s attention or making the viewer feel something seemed to always inspire me. I have made purchases solely on the appearance or design of it so I know firsthand the impact visuals can have on a person. I got into computer arts when my high school first offered a class a trial run. I loved it so much that I decided I wanted to do it as a career. My professor told me that KSU had a good program so without any hesitation I placed my application.
		My art interest include photography, minimalism, renesance, digital art, auto design, and logo design.</p>
